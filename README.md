# Deep Cooperative Neural Networks for Dual Attention Learning

The primary objective of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art dual-attention deep learning model that can simultaneously process and learn from user reviews and item descriptions. This model aims to enhance the interpretability and accuracy of recommendation systems by focusing on the most relevant textual information provided by both users and items. Implemented a dual-attention network where one branch focuses on user reviews and the other on item descriptions.


Traditional recommendation systems often rely on collaborative filtering or content-based methods, which may not fully capture the intricate details embedded in textual data. By utilizing deep learning techniques, especially attention mechanisms, it is possible to extract more meaningful features from textual content, leading to better recommendations. This project leverages the dual-attention mechanism to effectively process and highlight important parts of user reviews and item descriptions, thereby improving recommendation outcomes.
